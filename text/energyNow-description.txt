Billions of people start the day with a hot cup of coffee or tea.

But in some parts of the world, people wake up with a drink you may not be familiar with — yerba mate.

It was called “the drink of the gods” by many indigenous South Americans and later “the green gold of the Indios” by European settlers and is  a nutritional powerhouse loaded with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.

Yerba Mate is comes from the dried leaves of an evergreen holly, Ilex paraguariensis, a native plant of South America. Yerba mate is well-known for providing an energy boost that’s been described as gentle, clean, and calm; it rarely interferes with sleep and doesn’t cause the caffeine jitters.

KELP ALGAE
You already know to eat your daily servings of vegetables, but when is the last time you gave any thought to your sea vegetables? Kelp, a type of seaweed, is chock full of good-for-you nutrients that can benefit your health and possibly even prevent disease.

Because it absorbs the nutrients from its surrounding marine environment, kelp is rich in:

vitamins
minerals
trace elements
enzymes

According to nutritionist Vanessa Stasio Costa, M.S., R.D.N., C.D.N., kelp “is often considered a ‘superfood’ due to its significant mineral content. It’s especially concentrated in iodine, which is important for optimal thyroid function and metabolism.”
The benefits of these vitamins and nutrients are substantial. B vitamins in particular are essential for cellular metabolism and providing your body with energy. According to UCSF Medical Center, kelp has more calcium than many vegetables, including kale and collard greens.
