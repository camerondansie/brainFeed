            <p>Guarana, medically known as Paullinia Cupana, is actually one of the most popular forms of caffeine intake throughout South America. When you take a look at the health benefits and energy boost it provides, it’s not difficult to see why it’s growing in popularity.</p>

            <p>The first thing about guarana that makes it stand out is its stimulant properties. Guarana contains 3-7% caffeine. Compare that to coffee, which contains between one to two percent caffeine. Which is part of the reason we have chosen to include Guarana Seed Extract in our Fighter Function formula.</p>
        </td>
        <td>
            <p>The other part of the reason we've chosen to include it is, while the active ingredient in the guarana plant (guaranine) is chemically identical to caffeine, it has one huge difference. In its natural form, it is bound to the fiber of the guarana seeds. That means its stimulating component is released slowly, giving you up to five hours of refreshing vitality.</p>

            <p>The Guaranis people (who the fruit was named after) believed the plant could provide enough endurance that just by drinking it, one could go on a hunt for days without food and without feeling hunger or fatigue. They also credited the drink for helping cure headaches, relieve fever and painful muscle spasms, and help with bowel movement issues.</p>

            <p>You will find that the energy boost from natural guarana seed extract is much different than what you get from other forms of caffeine or other stimulants. For instance, it is gentle, long lasting, provides stamina, endurance, and doesn't cause headaches. Another key difference from caffeine derived from coffee and other stimulants is that Guaranine has also been shown in studies to improve memory and alertness and often improve a person's mood without the same negative side effects of coffee.†</p>

            <p>Cranberries are one of the richest fruits in health-promoting antioxidants. Antioxidants are essential to optimizing health by helping to combat the free radicals that can damage cellular structures as well as DNA. Loaded with beneficial nutrients and enzymes including manganese, vitamin C, fiber, and vitamin E.</p>

            <p>For many years, researchers believed that the ability of cranberries and cranberry juice to help prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) was partly related to the strong acidity of the cranberries. Recent research has shown that it's not the acidity of the cranberries, but the unusual nature of their proanthocyanidins (PACs) that is related to prevention of UTIs. The special structure of these PACs (involving A-type linkages between their components) acts as a barrier to bacteria that might otherwise latch on to the urinary tract lining.</p>

        <td colspan="4">This whole area of investigation has opened the door to an understanding of other possible cranberry benefits. For example, stomach ulcers are often related to overgrowth and over-linking of one particular type of stomach bacteria (Helicobacter pylori) to the stomach lining. In much the same way as cranberries may help prevent bacterial attachment to the lining of the urinary tract, they may also help prevent attachment of bacteria to the stomach lining. There is already some preliminary evidence that cranberry may help protect us from stomach ulcer in this way.<span>†</span></td>
